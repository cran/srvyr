\description{
This is a helper to allow srvyr's syntactic style. In particular, it tells
functions inside of a summarize call what survey to use. In general, users
will not have to worry about getting (or setting) the current conext's survey,
unless they are trying to extend srvyr. See \code{vignette("extending-srvyr")}
for more details.
