\title{Filtering joins from dplyr}
\description{
These are data manipulation functions designed to work on a \code{tbl_svy} object
and another data frame or \code{tbl_svy} object.
}
\details{
\code{semi_join} and \code{anti_join} filter certain observations from a \code{tbl_svy}
depending on the presence or absence of matches in another table.
See \code{\link[dplyr]{filter-joins}} for more details.

Mutating joins (\code{full_join}, \code{left_join}, etc.) are not implemented
for any \code{tbl_svy} objects. These data manipulations
may require modifications to the survey variable specifications and so
cannot be done automatically. Instead, use dplyr to perform them while the
data is still stored in data.frames.
